/* 
UNIT TESTS:
prompt 1: A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

Considering (x,y) to be input integers:
1. Expect multiply(x,y) to multiply the two integers
2. Expect multiply(x,y) to output a number type
3. Expect multiply(5, 12) to equal 60
4. Expect multiply("four", 5) to return an error



prompt 2: A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

1. Expect concatOdds() to concatenate two different arrays.
2. Expect concatOdds() to return an array that only contains the odd numbers from each array.
3. Expect concatOdds() to return the odd numbers array in ascending order.
4. Expect concatOdds([1, 3 ,5 ,7 ,9], [1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 13, 21]) to return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 21].
5. Expect concatOdds() to take recurring numbers in the array, and return them as a single number (ex: two "1" values returning in the array as just "1").
6. Expect concatOdds() to return an error if the user inputs strings or uses a string array.
7. Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [10, 20, 40]) to return an empty array/error, for they are even numbers.
